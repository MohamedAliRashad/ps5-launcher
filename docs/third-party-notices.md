# Third-party distribution notices

This release contains third-party software. These notices do not set or change
PS5 Launcher's own license and are not comprehensive legal certification.

The adjacent `licenses/inventory.json` lists active default-feature Rust
dependencies for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, using locked Cargo metadata and the
normal/build dependency tree. Build-time dependencies are conservatively included;
dev-only and unused optional dependencies are excluded. Original Cargo license
fields and normalized SPDX expressions are recorded separately. Except for the
Slint choice below, expressions are declarations, not a legal determination or
selection among alternatives. An `AND` must not be read as `OR`.

## Preserved documents and provenance

- `licenses/crates/` retains upstream LICENSE, NOTICE, COPYING, COPYRIGHT,
  AUTHORS and license-directory documents discovered recursively in cached
  source packages, including vendored native libraries. Texts are not rewritten.
- Where a published crate omits its license documents, the helper retrieves
  applicable documents from its official GitHub repository **at the published
  crate's VCS commit**, not a moving default branch. The inventory records URLs
  and SHA-256 hashes. A complete repository tree is checked for applicable
  standalone NOTICE files at the root, package ancestors and package subtree;
  an empty `noticePaths` means none was found in that scope, not that one was
  invented or that all inline source notices were audited.
- `licenses/standard/Apache-2.0.txt` is a complete standard license copied from
  a selected local crate, with provenance. It supplements short Apache headers;
  it does **not** replace upstream copyright or NOTICE texts.
- `licenses/assets/fonts/` retains the bundled fonts' discovered licensing
  documents. Non-Cargo assets and generated/embedded code need separate review.
- For `option-ext` under MPL-2.0, `licenses/crates/option-ext@0.2.0/source/`
  contains its exact cached source package. That Covered Software source is
  available under MPL-2.0; this does not relicense the larger application.

Unknown missing license sources, incomplete repository listings, unreadable
documents, unsafe paths and failed upstream requests stop packaging. Upstream
retrieval requires explicit `--allow-upstream`; Cargo itself runs locked/offline
after the release build populates its cache. The helper never publishes anything.

## Slint 1.18.1 — royalty-free desktop application choice

The Slint framework is used under
**LicenseRef-Slint-Royalty-free-2.0**, not by selecting its GPL or commercial
alternative. The full license and upstream licensing overview are retained in
the Slint packages' upstream document directories.

**Archive notices alone do not satisfy section 2 attribution.** The exact
[official version 2.0 license, section 2](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/v1.18.1/LICENSES/LicenseRef-Slint-Royalty-free-2.0.md#2-license-conditions---attribution)
requires either:

1. Display the **`AboutSlint` widget** in an About screen/dialog accessible from
   the application's top-level menu; if there is no such screen/dialog, display
   the widget in the splash screen; **or**
2. Display the **official Slint attribution badge** on a public webpage,
   preferably the binary download page, easily found by any visitor.

Thus visible **in-application** attribution is not mandatory if the public badge
alternative is actually fulfilled. For the application route, a plain Settings
row saying “Built with Slint” or a text hyperlink is **not the specified widget**.
There is no standalone text sentence prescribed as a substitute. The official
[AboutSlint documentation](https://docs.slint.dev/latest/docs/slint/reference/std-widgets/misc/aboutslint/)
describes the widget as displaying a **“Made with Slint”** badge. Use the widget
or the [official badge linked by the license](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/master/logo/MadeWithSlint-logo-whitebg.png),
not a reconstructed text-only credit. Verify one route before publishing.

The desktop grant excludes embedded-system use and applications exposing Slint
APIs. These notices do not establish eligibility for a different distribution
model or a commercial agreement.

## librqbit 9.0.1

The librqbit workspace crates declare Apache-2.0. Their published source packages
omit license documents. The retained
[official upstream license](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/blob/v9.0.1/LICENSE)
states **Copyright 2021 Igor Katson** and the Apache-2.0 license notice. It is
distributed unchanged alongside the full standard Apache-2.0 text. The audited
v9.0.1 repository tree has no applicable standalone NOTICE file. This is not a
claim that no other source attribution exists. Apache-2.0 does not impose a
general in-application “Built with librqbit” branding requirement.

## Scope requiring separate review

This is a source-document retention mechanism, not a complete binary-content or
legal audit. It does not certify toolchain/runtime licensing, system libraries
(including externally loaded libarchive), non-Cargo assets, changes to upstream
code, patent/trademark rights, or application license selection. Installation or
repackaging must retain these documents; the existing installer is not modified
by this packaging change. Review obligations again when dependencies, features,
target platform or distribution contents change.
