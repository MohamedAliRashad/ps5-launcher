# PS5 Launcher

A PS5-style home screen for Linux and macOS. Browse PS4 and PS5 games with their official artwork,
download and install them, and play them with the [KytyPS5](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5) (PS5)
and [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4) (PS4) emulators, using a controller, keyboard or
mouse.

![PS5 Launcher: the Home screen, a Game Hub, then the Library filtered to PS4 games and a PS4 game's Hub](docs/demo/demo-loop.webp)

- **Your games on a PS5-style Home screen**, with official backgrounds, logos and trailers that
  play right in the launcher.
- **A Library of 400+ PS5 games** with search, genre filters and sorting.
- **PS4 games too:** they run on shadPS4, which the launcher installs and updates by itself, like KytyPS5.
- **See what runs:** every game shows how far it gets in its emulator.
- **Download, install and play** without leaving the launcher.
- **Keeps itself and KytyPS5 up to date**, without touching your saves.

## Install

You need 64-bit Linux: Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, Mint 21+, Arch or SteamOS 3.
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MohamedAliRashad/ps5-launcher/releases/latest/download/ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz && ./ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64/install.sh
```

**PS5 Launcher** is now in your app menu. For trailers, switching between a game and the
launcher, and installing from archives, also run (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint):

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool mpv libarchive13
```

To uninstall: `./ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64/install.sh --uninstall`

### Or install a package

Each release has a package for your distribution (download it from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/MohamedAliRashad/ps5-launcher/releases/latest)). It adds PS5
Launcher to the app menu of KDE, GNOME and other desktops, and pulls in the libraries it needs.

```bash
sudo apt install ./ps5-launcher_*_amd64.deb           # Ubuntu, Debian, Mint
sudo dnf install ./ps5-launcher-*.x86_64.rpm          # Fedora
sudo pacman -U ps5-launcher-*-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst      # Arch
```

The package manager updates a packaged launcher, not the launcher itself.

### Or use the AppImage

One file that runs on most distributions, with nothing to install. Download
`ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage` from the Releases page, then:

```bash
chmod +x ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage && ./ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

Most distributions need FUSE 2 for AppImages (`sudo apt install libfuse2` on Ubuntu; without it,
run it as `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 ./ps5-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage`). Install the helpers
from above (`xdotool`, `mpv`, `libarchive`) on the system. An AppImage updates itself: it
replaces its own file, so keep it in a folder you can write to.

### Or run it as the whole screen, with no desktop

The package also adds a login session called **PS5 Launcher**. Install
[gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) (`sudo dnf install gamescope`, `sudo pacman -S gamescope`;
Ubuntu 24.04 does not ship it), log out, and choose **PS5 Launcher** at the login screen. The
launcher then fills the screen and is the only thing running, like a game console. On a PC
without a desktop, run `ps5-launcher-session` from a text console. In this session Settings
offers **Restart** and **Power off**. To log in to it by itself, see
[packaging/linux/README.md](packaging/linux/README.md).

## macOS

macOS 11 or later, Apple Silicon or Intel. KytyPS5's macOS build is x86-64 (with its own copy of MoltenVK for Vulkan), so on Apple Silicon it runs through
Rosetta 2.

1. Install the prerequisites once (Rosetta is for Apple Silicon only):

   ```bash
   softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
   brew install libarchive mpv   # mpv provides libmpv, which plays trailers inside the launcher
   ```

2. Download `ps5-launcher-macos-universal.zip` from the Releases page and unzip it.
3. Move **PS5 Launcher** to Applications.
4. Open it once as described under **"Not Opened" warning** below.
5. Continue with **Getting started** below. The launcher downloads KytyPS5 for you.

### "Not Opened: Apple could not verify…" warning

The app isn't notarized (that needs a paid Apple Developer account), so macOS blocks the first
launch of anything downloaded through a browser. It doesn't mean the file is damaged. Do one of:

- Right-click **PS5 Launcher** and choose **Open**, then **Open** again in the dialog.
- Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the
  blocked "PS5 Launcher" message (it appears after the first blocked attempt).
- Or in a terminal, remove the download flag:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PS5 Launcher.app"
  ```

If you downloaded just the bare `ps5-launcher` binary (for example a CI build) instead of the app,
it also needs the executable bit: `chmod +x ps5-launcher && xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ps5-launcher`.
Prefer the app: the bare binary has no icon and some window features work worse.

Controllers (through the system's game controller support), sound effects, games started outside
the launcher, choosing a display in Settings, and automatic updates of the app all work on macOS too.

What's different on macOS:

- **Many games won't start yet, and on Apple Silicon possibly none.** KytyPS5 needs Vulkan features
  that MoltenVK (the Vulkan-on-Metal layer) doesn't provide on Apple GPUs, and it exits at startup
  with "Could not find suitable device … image view minLod / shaderBufferInt64Atomics /
  shaderCullDistance is not supported". The launcher shows that reason when it happens. This is a
  limit of the emulator and MoltenVK, not of the launcher; see the compatibility badges on the
  game cards and kytyps5.github.io.
- **Switching between a game and the launcher** (the Tab and PS button shortcuts, Resume) needs
  *Privacy & Security → Accessibility* permission for PS5 Launcher. Without it the launcher still
  starts and stops games, but can't raise or close their windows.
  The app is signed ad hoc, so macOS may ask for the permission again after an update.
- **Automatic updates** replace the whole app, so it must be somewhere you can write to (such as
  `/Applications` as an admin user). Otherwise download the new zip.

## Or turn a spare PC into a console

**PS5 Launcher OS** makes a PC start straight into the launcher, like a console. It's
[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), a gaming Linux, with the launcher built in. The launcher, its
emulators and the system all keep themselves up to date.

**You need:**
- A USB stick (2 GB or more) and an internet connection, cable or Wi-Fi.
- A PC that can run the games: a 4-core CPU from 2013 or later (Intel Haswell or AMD Excavator
  and newer), 8 GB RAM (16 GB for PS5 games), a graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 (AMD, NVIDIA or
  Intel) and a 64 GB disk.

**Installing erases the disk you pick.**

1. Download [ps5-launcher-os-x86_64.iso](https://github.com/MohamedAliRashad/ps5-launcher/releases/latest/download/ps5-launcher-os-x86_64.iso)
   and write it to the USB stick with [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io) or
   [Fedora Media Writer](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download).
2. Start the PC from the USB stick (press F12, F11, F8 or Esc while it starts) and choose
   **Install PS5 Launcher OS**.
3. In the installer, choose your language, then on the summary screen:
   - **Network & Host Name:** connect to Wi-Fi if you have no cable.
   - **Installation Destination:** pick the disk and press **Done**. Leave **Encrypt my data**
     off, or the PC asks for a passphrase every time it starts.
   - **Time & Date:** pick your city (the launcher shows the time).
   - **User Creation:** your name and a password.

   Then **Begin Installation**. It downloads the system (about 7 GB), so it takes a while. The
   installer says "Fedora": Bazzite is built on Fedora and uses its installer.
4. Press **Reboot System**, remove the USB stick and stay at the PC. If Secure Boot is on, a blue
   **Perform MOK management** screen appears once and waits about 5 minutes. Use the arrow keys
   and Enter: **Enroll MOK**, **Continue**, then **Yes** (it starts on No), type `universalblue`,
   Enter, then **Reboot**. Missed it, and now the PC stops with "bad shim signature"? Start
   from the USB stick again, choose **Troubleshooting → Enroll the Secure Boot key again**, and
   the blue screen comes back.

The PC now starts straight into PS5 Launcher, and it picks the NVIDIA version of the system by
itself when it finds an NVIDIA graphics card. To get to the desktop, quit the launcher
(**Settings → Quit**); it opens again at the next start or from the app menu.

## Getting started

1. Open **PS5 Launcher** from your app menu, or run this in a terminal:

   ```bash
   ps5-launcher
   ```

   The first launch downloads artwork and KytyPS5, which takes about a minute.
2. Already have games? Add their folder in **Settings → Game folders**.
3. To get a game, open it in the **Library**, choose **Download**, then **Install**, then
   **Play**. Keep the launcher open while it downloads.

> Only download games you own. Downloads use BitTorrent: other people can see your IP address,
> and finished downloads are shared while the launcher is open (turn this off in
> **Settings → Keep sharing finished downloads**).

## Controls

| Action | Controller | Keyboard |
|---|---|---|
| Move / Select / Back | D-pad, ✕, ○ | Arrows, Enter, Esc |
| Options for a game | Options | O |
| Search | △ | / |
| Switch Home ⇄ Library | L1 / R1 | Tab |
| Switch between game and launcher | PS button | |
| Downloads | | Ctrl+D |

**Games play best with a controller.** DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox and most other controllers
work in games over USB or Bluetooth with no setup; connect yours before starting a game. Without
one, games use the keyboard: **J I K L** for ✕ △ □ ○, **W A S D** to move, **arrow keys** for the
D-pad and **Enter** for Options (PS4 games use **N C V B** for ✕ △ □ ○). See **Settings → Keyboard
controls in games** for every key.

## Will my game run?

Each game shows a tag from its emulator's community list ([KytyPS5](https://kytyps5.github.io/) for
PS5, [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-compatibility/shadps4-game-compatibility) for PS4):
🟢 **In-game**, 🟡 **Menus**, 🟠 **Boots** (intro logos only), 🔴 **Doesn't boot**, or ⚪ **Untested**.

Linux results come first. A result from Windows is marked **Win**, because games can behave
differently on Linux. In the Library, **In-game** lists every game that reaches gameplay, and
**In-game on Linux** only the ones confirmed on Linux.

**Help others:** when you close a game, the launcher asks how far it got, and your answer
becomes its tag on your PC. Every so often, choose **Settings → Share your game ratings** to send
your results to the community lists (needs a free GitHub account).

PS4 releases shipped as **PKG packages** install like any other: the launcher unpacks the game,
its update and its DLC for shadPS4 (it fetches a small PKG extractor the first time, and needs
Linux 5.13 or newer). PS5 PKG
releases can't be installed; pick a release that is a folder, an archive or an exFAT image.

## Help

- **A game closes right away:** check its tag, then **Options → View emulator log**.
- **Resume or Stop doesn't work:** install `xdotool`.
- **Wrong screen:** change **Settings → Display**. Choose **Active display** to start on the display the mouse pointer is on (macOS, and Linux with `xdotool`). For a window, run `ps5-launcher --windowed`.
- **Too big or too small:** run `PS5_LAUNCHER_SCALE=1.15 ps5-launcher` (bigger number, bigger UI).
- **A new KytyPS5 broke a game:** **Settings → Roll back to previous KytyPS5**.
