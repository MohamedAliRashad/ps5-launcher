"""Automated UI audit: finds selected/highlighted elements that are cut off by their container.

How it works:
  * The launcher runs without artwork (PS5_LAUNCHER_NO_ART=1) under a real window manager on
    hidden X displays, so the only bright-white shapes on screen are interface elements:
    selected buttons, selected chips, menu items, the Start button.
  * The script walks the selection through every screen (Home, Library, Game Hub, menu,
    Settings, screenshots) at several screen sizes and captures every step.
  * Every white shape in this design has rounded ends. A white shape whose edge is a perfectly
    straight line along its full height (or width) was cut off by something - that is the bug.

    scripts/ui_audit.py                    # default sizes
    scripts/ui_audit.py 1280x720           # one size

Writes dist/ui-audit/<size>/*.png and dist/ui-audit/report.txt (with crops of each problem).
Exit code 1 if anything was found. Needs: Xvfb, xfwm4, xdotool, ImageMagick, numpy, scipy.
